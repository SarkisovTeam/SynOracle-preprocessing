0.730 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 40 mL methanol and sonicated for 10 min to form solution A. Similarly, 3.285 g of 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in 40 mL methanol and sonicated for 10 min to form solution B. The two solutions were then mixed and stirred vigorously for 3 h at 25 ± 2 °C. Subsequently, the turbid mixture was separated by centrifugation (10000 rpm) yielding white precipitates that were washed with methanol three times and once with ethanol before drying at 60 °C under vacuum.
