All chemicals were purchased from commercial sources (Aldrich and VWR) and used as received without further purification. The solvents used for the synthesis were of analytical reagent grade. The synthesis of ZIF-8 was assisted by microwave irradiation and ultrasound. Three mixtures of solvent were used (deionized water/dimethylformamide) (W/D), (deionized water/methanol) (W/M) and (deionized water/deionized water) (W/W). In brief, 0,2 g ZnO and 0.8 g 2-methylimidazole (Hmim) were added separately into 15 mL of deionized water (W) and 15 mL of deionized water or DMF (D) or methanol (M). Then, the zinc oxide solution was added to Hmim solution, and the mixture was stirred for 10 min in ultrasonic bath before applying both microwave and ultrasound at 65 °C for 30 min to yield different materials named respectively ZIF-8-W-(US or MW), ZIF-8-WD-(US or MW) and ZIF-8-WM-(US or MW). The white color product was separated using centrifuge in 4000 rpm for 10 min and washed several times with deionized water.
